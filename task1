Git (in a git repository) identifies authors and committers by email address. Github users can associate email addresses with their accounts. When a user's set of email addresses is found in the commit history of a github repo, github marks that user as a contributor.

GH Enterprise docs seem to be consistent with contributors only being associated with email addresses.
Collaborators

A user that has defined permissions in a github repo is marked as a collaborator. These permissions can vary and do not need to be the commit bit. A random org I am a member of shows the following options presently:

    read
    write
    admin
    issue triage
    non-admin manager
